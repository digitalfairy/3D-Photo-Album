## ✨ Project Showcase & Technical Focus

This project is a high-performance, responsive virtual photo album that features:

* **Realistic 3D Interaction:** Utilizes **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)** to render a customizable book model with physically-based page-turning animations.
* **Dynamic UI Architecture:** Implements distinct, adaptive navigation patterns—a **full-width scroll** for desktop and a **compact columnar grid** for mobile—showcasing advanced **Tailwind CSS** responsiveness.
* **Scalable State Management:** Uses **Jotai** for efficient, atomic state management of page content, index tracking, and component synchronization.
* **Full-Stack Integration:** Features a decoupled architecture with a **React** frontend (Vercel) and a dedicated **Node.js/Express** backend (Render).
