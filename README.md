# 📸 Personalized 3D Photo Album Designer

An interactive web application demonstrating expertise in combining modern frontend frameworks with 3D rendering technologies to create a realistic, personalized digital photo album experience.

## ✨ Project Showcase & Technical Focus

This project is a high-performance, responsive virtual photo album that features:

* **Realistic 3D Interaction:** Utilizes **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)** to render a customizable book model with physically-based page-turning animations.
* **Dynamic UI Architecture:** Implements distinct, adaptive navigation patterns—a **full-width scroll** for desktop and a **compact columnar grid** for mobile—showcasing advanced **Tailwind CSS** responsiveness.
* **Scalable State Management:** Uses **Jotai** for efficient, atomic state management of page content, index tracking, and component synchronization (e.g., UI buttons matching the 3D book's current page).
* **Modular Component Design:** Follows React best practices with clear separation of concerns (e.g., `UI.jsx` for navigation, dedicated components for 3D rendering and authentication).
